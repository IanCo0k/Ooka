      [`The current pool of PG's in the NBA has a great mix of young and veteran talent, and
      the upcoming season promises to have all of that talent on full display. Here are
      the top 5 Floor Generals to look out for as the 2022-2023 season soon begins`,
    `DISCLAIMER: Damian Lillard will not be included due to last year's injury (but he 
      otherwise would be on this list)`,
    `#5: KYRIE IRVING`,
    `With the departure of James Harden to Philly, we can expect Kyrie to resume
    his role as the startin PG in Brooklyn. When Kyrie is available and on the
    floor (which isn't the reality a lot of the time, unfortunately),
    he is a generational type offense talent. Few can score the basketball
    as efficiently and as gracefully as Kyrie Irving. He is a 50/40/90 guy who can
    give you a ridiculously efficient 50 piece on any given night.`,
    `#4: JA MORANT`,
    `Ja Morant finally made his ascension to stardom during the 2022 NBA Season. He
    went from fringe all-star to MVP candidate, and even manage to win MIP, increasing
    his scoring average by 8 PPG and leading the Grizzlies to be one of the top seeds
    in the west. He has an unreal amount of confidence, and is already a proven playoff performer at just
    23.`,
    `#3: TRAE YOUNG`,
    `Trae Young is an offensive juggernaut. He is 23 years old, and has averaged close
    to 30 and 10 in two seperate seasons, which has only been done by 4 other players
    in the history of the NBA. The defensive limitations are there, but let's 
    not act like any other guy on this list is a brick wall on defense either... 
    His offensive contributions more than make up for it. He's a guy that can lead
    you on a deep playoff run as the #1 guy, and the Hawks recent moves to surround
    him with defenders will only help that reality.`,
    `#2: LUKA DONCIC`,
    `Luka Doncic is the definition of a superstar. At the age of 22, Luka already has 3 All-NBA 
    selections to his name, and has posted some of the most absurd averages the league
    has ever seen for people his age. More importantly, Luka has proven to be someone
    that you can rely on to carry you through a playoff series. There's 82 game guys, and then
    there is 16 game guys... Luka is a 16 game guy. He plays at an MVP level all 
    regular season, and still manages to elevate his game come playoff time. He is one
    of the most elite offensive talents the league has ever seen, and he's only going
    into his 5th season.`,
    `#1: Stephen Curry`,
    `Fresh off of his 1st Finals MVP (although he should have 2, maybe even 3...), there is
    no one more deserving of this spot. Steph is the greatest shooter the world has ever 
    seen, and he is the engine behind one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history. Nobody
    single-handedly shifts a defense like Wardell Stephen Curry. He is just as effective
    without the ball as he is with it, and he is just a WINNER.`],

    title: 'Ranking The Top 5 QB Performances Of Week 1',
    category: 'NCAA',
    subCategory: ['NCAA','Rankings'],

      [`With week one of the college football season in the books, here are the 5 quarterbacks that I felt performed the best. `,
      `5. Daniel Richardson | Central Michigan `,
      `Richardson looked poised against what was one of the best defenses in the country a year ago. OK St returned all of their D-line production that led the nation in sacks last year. Richardson put up great numbers in game one despite of that and led the Chips to a very respectable showing against a tough opponent.`,
      `4. Spencer Sanders | Oklahoma State`,
      `Sanders followed up a great last season with an excellent performance in week one. He was able to get anything he wanted against CMU. He was great through the air and the ground which put the Cowboys out front early and they were able to hold onto their lead.`,
      `3. Stetson Bennett | Georgia `,
      `Bennett looked about as in control of the offense as I have seen in his career. He was the main catalyst for the complete domination of the Ducks. He looked incredibly comfortable all game long, making every throw look easy. Bennett had the perfect start to Georgia’s repeat attempt, throwing for a career high in passing yards in a game. `,
      `2. Drake Maye | North Carolina`,
      `Maye has put up two great games to start the year and he was able to get it done both through the air and on the ground. The Tarheels needed all of Maye’s performance to get the win over App State which is why this game ranks so highly for me. It’s impressive to see him perform this well in his first two games regardless of the opponents.`,
      `1. Anthony Richardson | Florida
      `,
      `This one is pretty easy for me. The one thing Richardson doesn’t have over these other guys is the gaudy passing numbers. Richardson however, made up for it by running for 3 TD’s. He was by far the best player on the field against Utah and it was pretty obvious. He led his team to the most impressive win of the week which puts him over these other guys as well. Richardson could continue to vault himself into to the top 10 of next years NFL Draft with more performances like this. `,],
